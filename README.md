# Materials for UVL Tutorial at SPLC'23

## Session 1: Textual Editing with UVLS

UVLS is an LSP that enables syntax highlighting, autocompletion, semantic analyses, and configuration for UVL models. 
In the tutorial, we will use the LSP in VSCode.

* VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
* VSCode extension for UVLS (includes UVLS, can also be installed in internal marketplace of VSCode): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=caradhras.uvls-code
* LSP repository: https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/uvl-lsp


## Session 2: Modeling UVL with FeatureIDE
FeatureIDE is a widely used environment integrated in Eclipse for feature-oriented software development. UVL models can read, stored, and graphically edited in FeatureIDE. Furthermore, FeatureIDE supports many advanced operations for feature-oriented software development that can be used with UVL.

* Homepage with prepackaged versions of Eclipse with FeatureIDE (use v.3.10.0 for your respective OS): https://featureide.github.io/
* FeatureIDE repository: https://github.com/FeatureIDE/FeatureIDE
* Java-based UVL parser used in FeatureIDE: https://github.com/Universal-Variability-Language/uvl-parser-java
